# Brain-Tumour-Detection using ML and Image Processing

In this project, we aim to build a CNN architecture which gives higher accuracy compared to the existing and standard models.


The main objectives of this project are
• Build a model which gives higher accuracy than the standard models
• Compare the accuracies with the standard models
• Use the various CNN layers and experiment with it in order to increase the accuracy
• Build a model which is different from the standard model
• Use two different datasets, having different number of images in order to compare which dataset gives higher accuracy
• For the given image, predict the class
